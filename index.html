    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Sneha Chowdary, currently pursuing my studies at SRM University, where I’m diving deep into the exciting world of technology and coding. I’ve always been passionate about programming and enjoy the thrill of solving complex problems through code. Over time, I’ve developed a strong foundation in various programming languages and am continually exploring new tools and technologies to broaden my skillset. Coding for me is more than just writing lines of code; it’s a creative process that allows me to build innovative solutions and make a tangible impact.
       In addition to my academic pursuits, I’m also involved in outreach activities, like workshops on mobile security, environmental initiatives such as Vriksharopan Mahotsav (a tree-planting event), and awareness programs on sustainable practices like rainwater harvesting.</p>
